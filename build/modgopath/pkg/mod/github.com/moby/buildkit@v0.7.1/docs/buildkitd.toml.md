## NAME

buildkitd.toml - configuration file for buildkitd


## DESCRIPTION

The TOML file used to configure the buildkitd daemon settings has a short
list of global settings followed by a series of sections for specific areas
of daemon configuration.

## EXAMPLE

The following is a complete **buildkitd.toml** configuration example,
please note some of the configuration is only good for edge cases, please
take care of it carefully.
